# temp_pony_gp
Temporary pony_gp repo until I can figure out how git works...

TO GET PROGRAM TO RUN:
Edit the function "get_fitness_file()" in pony_gp_util.c (located in src/util) to return the path to where you fitness file is.

TO EDIT USER PARAMS: 
Modify the key-value pairs in the function "get_params()" in pony_gp_util.c (located in src/util). The key is in quotes and the value is next to the key seperate by a comma.
